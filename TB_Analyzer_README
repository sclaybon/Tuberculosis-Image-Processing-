The Dataset folder contains:

•	Four Python Files:
a.	SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_without_TF_Testing.py
b.  SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_without_TF_Testing_Blackout.py
c.	SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_with_TF_Testing.py
d.	SLIDEANALYZER_ALL_with_TF_Testing.py
•	92 TIFF images of format P (x).TIF consisting of unlabeled tuberculosis positive images
•	One .npy file that includes bacilli locations using (x,y) coordinates

The Labeled folder contains:

•	92 TIFF images of format P (x).TIF consisting of labeled tuberculosis positive images

Note: TF_Testing means that the center locations of the software detected bacilli are compared to the (x,y) coordinates of the actual bacilli locations (which are considered groundtruth).
As such:

•	SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_without_TF_Testing.py 
a.	Outputs the number of software detected bacilli without comparing to groundtruth
b.	Only tests one image at a time (i.e. the image specified in the code)
•	SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_without_TF_Testing_Blackout.py 
a.	Outputs the number of software detected bacilli without comparing to groundtruth
b.	Only tests one image at a time (i.e. the image specified in the code)
c.  Will return "No Bacilli Found" if the number of grayscale pixels with a value greater than 5 is less than 3
•	SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_with_TF_Testing.py
a.	Outputs the number of software detected bacilli and compares them to groundtruth
b.	Outputs information such as True Positive, False Positive, Precision, and Recall
c.	Only tests one image at a time (i.e. the image specified in the code)
•	SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_with_TF_Testing.py
a.	Builds on SLIDEANALYZER_Individual_with_TF_Testing.py
b.	Runs through all P (x).TIF images in the folder that the code is placed in
c.	Saves all of the Information to an excel file via the ‘Pandas’ data handler package
